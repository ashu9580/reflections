When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I am working on another computer or collaborating with other developers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I may be working on a branch which is already updated by another developer on Git Hub or I may not need a particular branch for my program.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork means to copy a repository on Git Hub to our Git Hub account. It creates an identical repository with the same commits.
Clone means to copy a repository from Git Hub to our local drive. It also automatically creates a remote to that repository named origin.
Branches are what we copy when we clone or fork a repository.
