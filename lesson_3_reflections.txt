When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I am working on another computer or collaborating with other developers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I may be working on a branch which is already updated by another developer on Git Hub or I may not need a particular branch for my program.
